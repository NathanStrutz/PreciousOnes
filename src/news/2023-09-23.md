Last December we were in Uganda and had the beautiful opportunity to give out bibles. The next day a man came to find Nathan with tears in his eyes, he was so thankful and said they had been praying for a Bible for years. He said it was like a light had been brought into their home.

This is why we are doing what we are doing. People came for days and days after to put their name on a list. We cut it off at the first 500. There are 500 names of people that desperately want bibles.

All you have to do to help get bibles to people is show up this Saturday and eat a BBQ dinner!!! ðŸ˜ƒðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Tickets for food will be sold at the door!

Everything is $1 - there will be several kinds of BBQ to try (you get to vote for your favorite!)

The sides are $1 each

The deserts are each $1.

When you come you can buy the $1 tickets at the door. Then you can build your own plate based on preference and how much you would like!

Itâ€™s going to be a super fun night!!

Help us spread the word!!!
