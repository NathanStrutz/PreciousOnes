Our director and her family will be traveling to Uganda in November!! 🎉

I'd love to explain a bit more about the trip and what the money we are fundraising is for 😃

There will be 5 people going, Nathan and Alanda Strutz and 3 of their children-Jude, Aubri and Elly.

They will be covering their own travel expenses to get there. It's expensive, but they feel like it's what they are called to do.
So what are we raising money for? Doing ministry is expensive. Every time we have a gathering we will be feeding people. This is cultural and also the meal for the day for many. We will feed kids and run a VBS, we have to buy all the food and expenses to run that. When people travel with us (like Shannie our Ugandan director, and others that help with the ministry in Uganda) we pay for their travel expenses because they could not afford it and it would be a huge burden on them. Running a women's conference isn't expensive like it would be here, but it's still not free. Even just electricity, food and water costs. Plus, there are always unforeseen costs that come with missions trips. We will also be buying more fabric for them and seeds while we are there. So many exciting aspects of this ministry that God has opened the doors to!! ❤️🎉

I hope this helps understand what the money will be going towards!

Mission trips cost money, but oh how they connect hearts ❤️❤️
