Precious Ones Ministries would like to thank [House Theatre](https://housetheatre.org) for the donation of a piano to auction off! This was an incredibly generous act of selflessness that we cannot thank them for enough. Many other donations came in thanks to sweet gift. We are so grateful. All the money raised from this project is going to be spent directly on Bibles for our Precious Ones Women's Center. We are Praising God!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüéâ Thank you everyone!
